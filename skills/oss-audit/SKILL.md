# Score a repository against the oss-kit standard

This skill scores a repository against `STANDARD.md`, the file that ships with oss-kit and states every rule the kit holds, one at a time. Read that file at the start of every audit and treat its rules as the checklist. Do not write the rules down anywhere else, in this file or in your notes: `STANDARD.md` is the one place they live, a rule change there must not require a matching change here, and a copy that drifts from the source scores repositories against criteria the kit no longer holds.

Step 7's report is the one exception, and it is not a copy. Every run regenerates it from `STANDARD.md`, so it carries whatever the standard says today and cannot drift from it. What this paragraph forbids is a second authored place a rule has to be edited.

This skill owns no rule. It reads what `STANDARD.md` says a rule needs, checks the repository against that, and names the skill that owns the fix. It fixes nothing, and the only file it writes is the report in Step 7.

## Step 1: Find STANDARD.md

`STANDARD.md` sits next to this file, in this skill's own installed directory. Read it from there, not from the repository under audit. The audit runs with the target repository as the working directory, so a bare `STANDARD.md` or `./STANDARD.md` resolves against that repository and is the wrong file or no file. Resolve the standard from the absolute directory this `SKILL.md` was loaded from, and read `STANDARD.md` beside it.

The directory travels intact in every documented install, so the file is always beside this one: a git checkout, the Claude Code plugin install, `npx skills add svyatov/oss-kit --skill '*'` for the whole kit, and `npx skills add svyatov/oss-kit --skill oss-audit` for this skill alone. There is no documented install that brings in this skill's directory but leaves one of its own files behind.

If no `STANDARD.md` sits beside this file, the file is genuinely missing: the skill's own directory did not install completely, or the file was moved or deleted afterward. Say this plainly, name the file that is missing, and stop rather than guessing at another path or scoring against a remembered or reconstructed rule set. An audit with no rules to check against is not a smaller audit; it is no audit.

## Step 2: Read the rules

Each rule in `STANDARD.md` is a block with an ID (`R-<AREA>-<NN>`), a statement, one `Check:` line naming the evidence to look for, one `Fixed by:` line naming the skill that owns the fix, and one `Forges:` line naming whether the rule applies to GitHub, GitLab, or both. Read every block; do not sample.

Detect which forge the repository under audit uses: look for `.github/workflows/` or `.gitlab-ci.yml`, check the git remote, or ask if neither signal is present. Skip a rule whose `Forges:` line names only the other forge, and report it as not applicable rather than folding it into the pass, fail, or unknown counts.

A rule marked retired is not scored, and appears in no count. Its number is kept so nobody reuses it, which is the whole of what it is still doing there.

Then detect which distribution ecosystems the repository uses. `ecosystems.json` sits beside `STANDARD.md` in this skill's own installed directory, so Step 1's rule reads it: resolve it from the absolute directory this `SKILL.md` was loaded from, never from the repository under audit. It names every ecosystem the kit covers and, for each, the manifest and lockfile names that mark it, the registry it publishes to, and the release track it takes. Where it disagrees with anything written in prose, including the files this skill's `references/ecosystems/` directory ships, it wins. If it is missing, say so, and score what you can from the manifests you find rather than reconstructing a roster from memory.

Detection runs on two axes, and the two answers stay apart.

An ecosystem is present when any manifest or lockfile the roster lists for it turns up anywhere in the checkout. A dev-only manifest counts. So does one that builds the docs site, one inside an example, and one that declares nothing publishable at all.

An ecosystem is shipped when the repository publishes to it. The release area's preamble states what makes an artifact published, and that is the evidence to look for; for container images, which have no manifest, the signal is a push to a registry rather than a Dockerfile.

Keeping the axes apart is what makes the rest of the audit accurate. What a repository ships is what reaches the PUB area and R-CHG-07. What is merely present is what reaches R-CI-03, R-SEC-03, R-SEC-08, and R-SEC-11, because a vulnerability arrives through a dependency whether or not anything is published from it. Fold the two together and a Go command-line tool carrying a `package.json` under `docs/` gets told to configure npm trusted publishing, while a repository that ships a gem and builds its site with npm has its npm lockfile scored as though it were not there.

The signals that decide each ecosystem, including the cases that are easy to get backwards, a `package.json` carrying `"private": true`, a manifest that exists only to configure a linter, and a lockfile with no manifest beside it, are in `references/ecosystems/<name>.md`, one file per roster entry. Read the file for an ecosystem before recording it as shipped, present, or absent.

Some areas carry a preamble under their own `##` heading that gates the area rather than any single rule, scoping it to a kind of repository rather than to a forge. Read that preamble before the area's first rule. Where its precondition is unmet, mark the whole area not applicable in one step and report it that way, rather than checking its rules one at a time. Where a precondition names a file, resolve symlinked directories before concluding the file is absent, as R-SKL-01's check requires.

## Step 3: Check each rule, area by area

`STANDARD.md`'s areas, DOC, COM, CI, SEC, PUB, CHG, and SKL, are independent and share no state, so they can be checked in any order. An area gated on a precondition states that precondition in its own preamble, and Step 2 resolved it. More than one skill can own rules within one area, so read each rule's own `Fixed by:` line rather than assuming every rule in an area routes to the same place.

Run `scripts/collect.mjs` from this skill's own directory first, against the repository under audit. It prints as JSON the facts the `Check:` lines reference that a machine can read without judgement: which license, community, and template files exist and at which of their accepted paths, every workflow's triggers and permissions, every job with its `timeout-minutes`, every `uses:` with whether it resolves to a 40-character SHA, and the README's and changelog's headings, fenced blocks, links, and link definitions. One run replaces the twenty to thirty shell commands an audit otherwise spends deriving the same things.

```sh
node <this skill's directory>/scripts/collect.mjs <repository root>
```

It parses the workflow rather than matching lines in it, and that is the point. A regex over job-shaped lines counts a top-level `env:` block's keys as jobs, which is how one audit reported every job as missing a timeout when none was. It also reads every `action.yml` the repository ships, because a composite action's steps take `uses:` and an unpinned action there is invisible to any scan of `.github/workflows` alone.

The script decides no rule. Whether the sentence before a code block names that block's destination, or whether a differentiator carries evidence, is judgement and stays below. Prose findings are `oss-writing`'s, through the `scripts/prose.mjs` that skill ships, so nothing here duplicates its banned-word table.

Where the script is absent or errors, gather the same facts by reading files and say in the report that you did. Nothing in the audit depends on it existing.

For every applicable rule, turn its `Check:` line into an observation against the repository: open the file or configuration it names, and record what is actually there. A `Check:` line asking whether the README's first paragraph is a single sentence before any heading is answered by reading `README.md`. A `Check:` line asking whether every `uses:` line resolves to a 40-character SHA is answered by reading every workflow file. Mark the rule pass when the evidence matches what the `Check:` line asks for and fail when it does not. Hold both to the same standard of evidence, whether or not the rule reaches the report: a fail with no evidence is a guess rather than a finding, and a pass with no evidence is the score that discredits every other one.

A rule met by a fallback the standard marks below the bar is a pass, and counts as one. Give that rule a report line naming which fallback carried it, which is the one place a pass earns a line of its own. `STANDARD.md`'s preamble tells the reader to revisit a below-the-bar fallback when the platform catches up, and an unqualified pass leaves them nothing to revisit: a maintainer publishing on a long-lived scoped token reads that pass and never learns they are on the degraded variant.

Some `Check:` lines name evidence that exists once per ecosystem rather than once per repository: a lockfile, a toolchain matrix, an update configuration, a vulnerability feed. Score such a rule against every ecosystem the relevant axis from Step 2 puts in scope for it, one observation each, and mark it pass only when every one of them passes. One failing ecosystem fails the rule, because a repository whose Ruby dependencies are watched and whose JavaScript ones are not is not two thirds covered, it is uncovered on one side. Carry the ecosystem name with the observation; Step 6 puts it in the finding.

The PUB area resolves in one step from the shipped set, not rule by rule. Where nothing is shipped, the whole area is not applicable, which is Step 2's preamble handling and nothing more. Where something is shipped, read the preamble for the track each shipped ecosystem takes, confirm it against that ecosystem's `references/ecosystems/<name>.md`, and record the track once. The track decides which of the area's rules reach the repository at all, so a repository on the tag-published track has the rules that track drops marked not applicable together, on one scope sentence, and they are not checked one at a time. A repository shipping on both tracks scores each rule against the ecosystems whose track keeps it.

Mark a rule not applicable only when its area preamble, rule text, or `Check:` line states a precondition that the repository does not meet. Do not infer an unstated precondition from missing evidence: where the rule requires a file, setting, or value and does not define an exception, its absence is a failure. Record the scope sentence that made each rule not applicable so another audit reaches the same result.

## Step 4: Report unknown where the checkout cannot answer

Some `Check:` lines name evidence a repository checkout does not carry on its own: a forge API call (branch protection settings, environment approvers, a job token's scope), a registry endpoint (whether a published package carries a provenance attestation), or a maintainer's signing key fetched from outside the repository. You do not need a list of which rules these are memorized ahead of time; the `Check:` line itself tells you, because it names the API call, the endpoint, or the external key it needs.

Where you actually have the access a `Check:` line asks for, network reachable, the right credentials available, use it and score the rule on what it returns. Where you do not, or an attempt fails, mark the rule unknown. Unknown is not a softened fail and not a cautious pass; it is a distinct third state, because a rule scored pass on no evidence is the failure mode that discredits every other score in the report. Give unknown its own line in the report, after the fails, and its own count. Never round unknown up to pass because the rest of the repository looks well kept, and never round it down to fail because access was inconvenient to get.

## Step 5: Count what you checked

Count the rules the standard defines before writing any total:

```bash
grep -c '^### R-' <absolute path to STANDARD.md>
```

Every rule you read carries exactly one status, so pass, fail, unknown, and not applicable add up to that number once the retired rules are subtracted from both sides. Subtract them explicitly: the grep counts a retired rule's heading, and a bare comparison drops the first retired ID into the unchecked bucket and reintroduces the mis-scoring Step 2 exists to prevent.

Where the four counts fall short, a rule has no status and is unchecked rather than passing. Go back to Step 3, check it, and count again. Do not report until the arithmetic closes.

## Step 6: Report

Report only what the maintainer has to act on. A rule that passed gets no line of its own, unless a below-the-bar fallback carried it. You checked every applicable rule and you hold the evidence for every one of them, but a reader who came for the gaps does not need thirty rows confirming what already works, and printing them pushes the four that matter off the screen.

Open with one count line: how many rules were applicable, how many of those passed, failed, or came back unknown, and how many were marked not applicable, whether for forge scope or for a missing precondition. State the unknown count on its own, next to the fail count, not folded into either the pass or the fail total. On a repository with nothing to fix this line is the whole report, and it is what tells the reader the audit ran rather than stalled.

Say in a parenthetical why the not-applicable rules were skipped, grouped by reason, so the reader can tell a rule that does not reach their repository from one the audit quietly dropped. Group by the scope sentence you recorded in Step 3 rather than listing rule IDs one by one. This is the count line's only qualifier; do not follow it with a section listing what was skipped.

Under it, give one line for the ecosystems you detected, with shipped and present kept apart and named in that order, and say plainly when nothing is shipped. Every per-ecosystem finding below was scored against one of those two sets, so a reader who disputes a finding needs to see which set produced it, and one sentence saying the repository publishes nothing is what explains an entire area marked not applicable.

Then list every fail and every unknown, most important first, one line each. A line carries the rule ID, the status, the evidence you found, and the skill named in that rule's `Fixed by:` line. Where the rule was scored per ecosystem, name the ecosystem that failed, before the evidence:

```text
Audited 50 applicable rules: 45 pass, 4 fail, 1 unknown, 9 not applicable
(7 SKL, the repository ships no agent skills; 1 GitLab-only; 1 where the
ecosystem does not encode the major version in package identity).
Ships rubygems. npm present through site/package.json and site/package-lock.json.

1. R-COM-01 fail, no LICENSE file, run oss-community
2. R-DOC-01 fail, README.md opens with a badge row before any sentence about the project, run oss-readme
3. R-SEC-01 fail, three uses: lines in .github/workflows/ci.yml pin a tag rather than a SHA, at lines 12, 19, and 31, run oss-harden
4. R-SEC-08 fail, npm: site/package-lock.json is committed but the docs job runs npm install rather than npm ci, run oss-harden
5. R-SEC-04 unknown, the check reads repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets and no forge access was available, run oss-harden
```

Naming the ecosystem is what completes the routing. Every skill that fixes an ecosystem-sensitive rule carries a `references/ecosystems/<name>.md` for each roster entry, so the skill from the `Fixed by:` line plus the ecosystem name is the address of the fix, and there is no roster entry that address fails to resolve for. Without the ecosystem, line 4 above sends a maintainer to read four files to work out which lockfile you meant.

The numbers above illustrate the shape. Derive yours from the count in Step 5.

The order is the priority, so there is no second list saying what to do first. Put every fail ahead of every unknown, since a fail is a confirmed gap and an unknown is only a gap in the audit itself. Within the fails, put a rule that blocks other rules from being checked or fixed ahead of an independent one: a missing license blocks the newcomer-facing community rules that assume the project can legally be used, a missing CONTRIBUTING.md blocks the CI rule that checks its commands match, and a missing SECURITY.md or unset branch protection blocks the security rules that build on it. Order the rest by what most reduces risk or friction for a new contributor.

Keep each line to one line. The evidence is the specific thing you found, with the file and where in it, and nothing else: the rule statement is in `STANDARD.md` and the fix is in the skill you just named, so restating either here costs the reader the scan the format exists to give them.

## Step 7: Write the report file

Write `oss-audit-report.md` at the root of the repository under audit. Step 6 is what the maintainer reads now; this file is what the fix work reads later, and the two carry different things. Step 6 prints only what needs acting on. This file records every verdict, because a later audit diffs against it, and a verdict that was never written down cannot be compared.

Say in the file's first lines that oss-audit generated it, name the commit it scored, and say it is untracked by default so the maintainer can commit it or delete it. Do not edit the repository's `.gitignore`. Writing one file the maintainer asked for is within scope; changing a tracked file they did not ask you to change is not.

The format is a contract, because a later run parses it. Use these four sections, in this order.

**Repository.** The facts you established in Step 2: forge and project path, shipped ecosystems, present ecosystems with the manifests that proved them, the CI configuration paths, the lockfiles, and how the project releases today. A fix session in a fresh context reads this instead of re-deriving it, and re-deriving it is most of what a fix session spends its first turns on.

**Prerequisites.** Every step the fix work needs that no API can perform: a registry's trusted-publisher form, anything behind a password or an MFA prompt, anything that exists only as a web form. Name the URL and the exact field values. The maintainer clears these before any fix group starts. Put this section above the verdicts even when it is empty, and say it is empty, because a reader who does not see the section cannot tell whether it was considered. A fix run that meets one of these mid-flight stalls with a loaded context window doing nothing, so the point of the section is that no fix session ever opens a browser.

**Verdicts.** One line per scored rule, including passes, in rule ID order:

```text
- R-DOC-01 pass README.md:3, one sentence before the first heading
- R-SEC-01 fail .github/workflows/main.yml:32,34,60 pin tags rather than SHAs
  Fixed by: oss-harden
  Check: every external `uses:` line in `.github/workflows/`, and in every
  `action.yml` or `action.yaml` the repository ships, ...
- R-SEC-04 unknown reads repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets, no forge access
  Fixed by: oss-harden
  Check: the default branch is protected, a pull request or merge request is ...
```

A verdict line opens `- `, then the rule ID, then `pass`, `fail`, `unknown`, or `n/a`, then the evidence. Where the rule scored per ecosystem, the ecosystem name comes before the evidence. A fail or an unknown carries two indented lines under it: `Fixed by:` naming the owning skill, and `Check:` quoting that rule's `Check:` line from `STANDARD.md` verbatim. A pass and a not-applicable carry neither, and a not-applicable carries the scope sentence as its evidence.

Quoting `Check:` verbatim is what makes a fix session self-sufficient. Without it every fix session reads `STANDARD.md` again to learn what the rule wanted, and reads it again each time the text scrolls out.

**Execution order.** One group per owning skill, one pull request per group, numbered in the order they should run. Every rule's `Fixed by:` line already decided which group it lands in, so compute the grouping rather than choosing it. Order the groups by the same dependency logic Step 6 orders findings by, and hold to three constraints:

- A group whose fixes other groups depend on runs before them.
- Tightening branch protection runs after the checks that protection will require exist and report.
- Cutting a release runs last, and gets its own final group. Rules that verify only against a published artifact or a newly pushed tag, which is where R-PUB-03 and R-SEC-05 sit, close there and nowhere earlier. Say so in that group, so a reader does not read them as defects they failed to fix.

Say in this section that each group is a fresh session that reads this file and works from it. A group finishing with a merged pull request is a checkpoint, so the next group starts from a small context rather than carrying every earlier group's in it. Carrying them all is what takes a run to a 300k window that every later turn then pays for.

Then close your reply with that same execution order, as the literal next invocations. The advice above is in a file nobody opens at the moment the decision gets made, so a run that reads it there goes on in the same session and pays for it in every later turn. Put it where the decision is:

```text
Fix in four sessions, one pull request each. Start each in a fresh session
in this repository; each reads oss-audit-report.md and needs no handover.

  1. oss-community   4 rules   branch docs/community-files
  2. oss-readme      6 rules   branch docs/readme-structure
  3. oss-harden      7 rules   branch ci/harden
  4. oss-publish     4 rules   branch build/release-workflow
     last: cuts the release, closes R-PUB-03 and R-SEC-05
```

One line per group, in the order this section computed, with the rule count and the branch name from `oss-writing`'s branch rule. Name the skill as the host invokes it: a slash command where this kit is installed as a plugin, the bare skill name otherwise. Where a group closes rules that can only close after a release, say so on its line rather than leaving the maintainer to read it as unfinished work.

## Step 8: Audit again, and diff

When the fix groups are done, run this skill again and diff the new report against the one the first run wrote. Keep both. The diff is the only evidence that a rule the first audit passed is still passing, and that a rule it failed is actually closed rather than reported closed.

Read three things out of it. A verdict that went from fail to pass is a fix landing. A verdict that went from pass to fail is either a fix that broke something else or a first audit that was wrong, and reading the file settles which. A verdict that did not move on a rule the plan targeted is a fix that did not take, whatever the fix session reported.

Say plainly what the diff shows, including a rule that moved for the second reason. A repository re-audited this way surfaced two rules the first audit had passed, a title-case heading and a changelog entry marked with the wrong emphasis, both of which predated the fix work and neither of which anything in the run would otherwise have caught.

The diff has one limit worth stating rather than discovering. It compares two runs, so it catches a verdict that moved and it cannot catch two runs that are wrong the same way. A rule both audits misread stays green across the diff. Only rescoring against the rule text catches that, which is what Step 3 is for.
